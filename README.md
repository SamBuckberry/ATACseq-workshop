# ATACseq-workshop

In this workshop we will explore the major steps in ATAC-seq data analysis, including pre-analysis quality checks, alignment, peak calling, peak differential analysis, peak annotation and motif enrichment. More advanced analyses such as nucleosome positioning and transcription factor footprinting are more in-depth exploration and may be covered in future workshops.
